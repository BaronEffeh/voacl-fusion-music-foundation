        Each of our events is thoughtfully crafted to build confidence, sharpen musical talent, and 
        create meaningful connections among students across diverse backgrounds â€” all through the shared 
        language of music. Whether on stage, in workshops, or during campfires, these experiences leave 
        lasting impressions that go beyond performance.
